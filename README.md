## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a high-accuracy model for recognizing handwritten alphabets using a deep learning approach. The project involves:

- Loading and preprocessing data
- Designing a CNN model with batch normalization and dropout
- Training and evaluating the model
- Using data augmentation techniques to improve model performance

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Advanced CNN architecture with:
  - Two convolutional layers
  - Max pooling
  - Batch normalization
  - Dropout
  - Fully connected layers
- Data augmentation for robust training
- Learning rate scheduling for optimized training

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following packages:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- torchvision

You can install the necessary packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwritten-alphabet-recognition.git
   cd handwritten-alphabet-recognition
   ```

2. **Download the dataset:**

   Place the dataset CSV file (`A_Z Handwritten Data.csv`) in the project directory. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/), or adjust the `file_path` in the code to point to the location of your dataset.

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Data:**

   Ensure that the dataset is correctly placed and paths are set in the script.

2. **Run the Training Script:**

   Execute the Python script to train the model:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

   This will load the data, train the CNN model, and print the training and validation metrics for each epoch.

## Training

The `train_model.py` script includes the following features:

- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Data augmentation (setup but not applied in this script)
- Model architecture definition
- Training loop with learning rate scheduling
- Validation and evaluation metrics

**Training Parameters:**

- Epochs: 25
- Batch Size: 64
- Learning Rate: 0.001
- Weight Decay: 1e-4
- Learning Rate Scheduler: StepLR (step_size=5, gamma=0.5)

## Results

After training, you can expect to see the following outputs:

- Training and validation loss
- Training and validation accuracy

These metrics will help you evaluate the performance of the model and make necessary adjustments.
